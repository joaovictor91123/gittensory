// Public-safe rendering for AI-generated E2E test coverage (#4193, part of the #4189 epic).
//
// Unlike fix-handoff (which splices a block into the automated review's sticky unified comment), this
// renders its OWN dedicated reply comment for the `@gittensory generate-tests` command (#4195) — a
// maintainer-triggered, on-demand action, not something that runs on every automated review pass. This
// mirrors how `explain`/`configuration` already post their own on-demand response comments rather than
// editing the main review comment (see `maybeProcessExplainCommand` in `src/queue/processors.ts`).
//
// This layer never re-derives safety: it trusts that #4191's `parseE2eTestGenResponse` already validated
// the test source is plausible Playwright before this ever sees it, and that #4195's caller already
// resolved authorization — this file only turns already-decided content into a public-safe comment body.
