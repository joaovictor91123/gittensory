 * caller omitted it entirely. CLI providers (`claude-cli`, `codex-cli`) have no hook-registration surface, and
 * the engine fails closed if `hooks` is supplied to them at all -- so the default is scoped to `agent-sdk`
 * only; a CLI attempt with no explicit `hooks` gets none (today's inert no-op), while one that explicitly
 * supplies `hooks` still gets the engine's real fail-closed rejection instead of a silently unenforced run.
